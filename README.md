# hdx-vue

> Vue visualization components for Humanitartan Data Exchange

This project should provide vue components that would make it easier to
build HDX data visualizations by fetching data via CKAN web-api.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
